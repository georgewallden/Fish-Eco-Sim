# agent/__init__.py
#
# Description:
# This file serves as the initialization file for the 'agent' Python package.
# Its primary purpose is to allow classes and functions defined in the sub-modules
# (like `base.py` and `traits.py`) to be directly imported using the package name
# (e.g., `from agent import Agent`). It defines the public interface of the agent
# module, controlling which names are made available when the package is imported.
#
# Key responsibilities of this file:
# - Make the 'agent' directory a valid Python package.
# - Import key classes/functions from internal sub-modules to make them accessible
#   directly under the `agent` package namespace.
# - (Optional) Define an `__all__` list to explicitly control `from agent import *` behavior.
#
# Design Philosophy/Notes:
# - Provides a clean, top-level entry point for interacting with the core agent concepts.
# - Hides internal implementation details within the sub-modules (e.g., users of the
#   agent package typically don't need to directly import `agent.movement` or `agent.render`).

# Imports Description:
# This section lists the modules imported by agent/__init__.py and their purpose.
# - .base.Agent: Imports the main `Agent` class definition from the `base.py` module
#   within the same package. This makes the `Agent` class available directly as `agent.Agent`.
# - .traits.AgentTraits: Imports the `AgentTraits` class definition from the `traits.py`
#   module within the same package. This makes the `AgentTraits` class available directly
#   as `agent.AgentTraits`.
# - . import behavior: (Planned addition, conceptually needed for agents to interact with behavior logic)

# Code Block Descriptions:
# This section provides detailed blueprints for the code blocks implemented below.
# This file primarily consists of import statements that define the package's public API.

# 1. Public API Imports
# Description:
# Imports the main `Agent` class and `AgentTraits` class from their respective
# internal modules (`base.py` and `traits.py`) and makes them available
# directly under the `agent` package namespace. This simplifies imports
# for users of the `agent` package (like `world/__init__.py`).
# Process:
# Executes import statements.
# Output:
# None. Side effect is populating the `agent` package's namespace with the imported names.


# --- START CODE IMPLEMENTATION ---

# Imports:
# Standard library imports first

# Local package imports
# Import the main Agent class from the base module and make it publicly available
from .base import Agent

# Import the AgentTraits class from the traits module and make it publicly available
from .traits import AgentTraits

# Note: Internal modules like movement, render, behavior are typically not imported here
# unless they provide functions intended for direct use from outside the package.
# The Agent class itself calls functions from these modules.

# Optional: Define the __all__ list to explicitly control what 'from agent import *' imports
# __all__ = ['Agent', 'AgentTraits']


### 1. Public API Imports Implementation ###
# The actual import statements are already placed above, below the "Imports:" header,
# and define the public API. This block header serves as the link to the description
# above, but contains no additional code.
