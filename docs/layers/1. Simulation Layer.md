# 1. Simulation Layer - Design Document

**Version:** 2 (Revised for Alpha Roadmap Alignment)
**Last Updated:** 5/10/2025

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

*   This layer is the core "world engine" of the Fish Eco Sim, implemented in **Rust**. It defines and executes the fundamental rules of the 2D grid-based ocean world and the mechanics of how entities (agents, food, etc.) exist and interact within it.
*   Its primary responsibility is to maintain the authoritative state of the simulation (the ground truth), update this state over discrete time steps (ticks) based on defined mechanics and received agent actions, and provide a consistent environment. It handles the "physics" and "biology" of the simulated ecosystem.
*   Key goals include: high performance (many ticks per second, supporting many entities), correctness of implemented rules, providing necessary data (observations, rewards) to be relayed to the Agent Intelligence Layer, and operating headlessly as a worker process managed by the Orchestration Layer.

---

## 2. Core Components & Functionality (Targeted for Alpha PoC `a0.4.Y.Z` & `a0.5.Y.Z`)

*   **World Representation (`Grid` & `Cell` structures - Target: `a0.4.1.Z`):**
    *   Manages the 2D grid: dimensions from configuration.
    *   Handles world boundary conditions (e.g., clamping, future wrapping).
    *   `Cell` struct stores properties:
        *   `depth: f32` (e.g., linear gradient).
        *   `cell_type: CellType { OpenWater, SeaFloor }`.
        *   `is_occupied: bool`.
        *   `occupant_id: Option<EntityIdPlaceholder>` (and potentially `occupant_type`).
    *   Provides public API on `Grid` to query cell properties and manage occupancy.
*   **Simulation Loop & Tick Management (`SimulationClock`, `SimulationEngine` - Target: `a0.4.2.Z`):**
    *   `SimulationClock`: Manages `current_tick` and `SimRunStatus { Initializing, Running, Paused, Stopped }`.
    *   `SimulationEngine`: Contains `Grid`, `SimulationClock`, `AgentManager`, `FoodManager`.
    *   `process_single_tick_logic()`: Private method encapsulating phases within a tick (placeholders for Alpha):
        1.  Process Incoming Agent Actions.
        2.  Update Agent States & Mechanics.
        3.  Update Environment.
        4.  Generate Observations for Agents.
        5.  Publish World State & Events.
    *   `advance_simulation_n_ticks(n: u64)`: Public method to advance simulation.
    *   `main()` loop: Initializes engine, placeholder for receiving external control commands (from Orchestrator).
*   **Agent Entity & Traits (`Agent` struct - Target: `a0.4.3.Z`):**
    *   `Agent` struct with core fields: `id`, `position`, `current_energy`, `max_energy`, `age_ticks`, `direction`, `vision_range`, placeholders for `species_tag` and evolvable traits.
    *   Constructor takes initial parameters derived from configuration.
    *   Public methods for state access and modification (e.g., `gain_energy`, `lose_energy`, `set_position`, `increment_age`).
*   **Agent Lifecycle & Management (`AgentManager` - Target: `a0.4.4.Z`):**
    *   `AgentManager` struct: Tracks active agents (e.g., in a `HashMap`).
    *   Generates unique agent IDs.
    *   `spawn_new_agent()`: Creates an agent, places it on the `Grid` (updating occupancy).
    *   `process_agent_death()`: Removes agent from tracking, vacates its cell on the `Grid`.
    *   Methods to get/iterate agents.
*   **Food Entity & Management (`FoodPellet`, `FoodManager` - Target: `a0.4.5.Z`):**
    *   `FoodPellet` struct: `id`, `position`, `energy_value`.
    *   `FoodManager` struct: Tracks active food pellets.
    *   `spawn_food_pellet()`: Creates food, places it on the `Grid` (updating occupancy with `EntityType::Food`).
    *   `consume_food_pellet_at()`: Removes food, returns energy value, vacates cell.
    *   (Optional Alpha) `spawn_random_food()` logic.
*   **Basic Agent Mechanics & State Updates (Implemented in `SimulationEngine` tick phases - Target: `a0.4.6.Z`):**
    *   Passive energy drain per tick.
    *   Agent aging per tick.
    *   Death by starvation (triggers `AgentManager::process_agent_death`).
    *   Eating: If agent action is `Eat`, calls `FoodManager::consume_food_pellet_at()` and agent gains energy.
    *   Movement: If agent action is `Move`, calls `attempt_agent_move()` which updates agent position and `Grid` occupancy, applying energy cost.
*   **Internal Observation & Action Interfaces (Target: `a0.4.7.Z`):**
    *   `AgentObservationData` struct: Defines data agent perceives (energy, depth, age, nearest food, etc.).
    *   `AgentActionInput` enum: Defines actions agent can take (`Move(Direction)`, `Eat`, `DoNothing`).
    *   `generate_observation_for_agent()`: Rust function to create `AgentObservationData`.
    *   `apply_action_to_agent()`: Rust function to process `AgentActionInput`, trigger mechanics, and calculate basic reward.
*   **Orchestrator Communication Integration (Target: `a0.5.Y.Z`):**
    *   Implement gRPC client to register with Go Orchestrator.
    *   Package internal simulation data (`WorldStateUpdate`, `AgentObservationData`, `AgentDied` events, rewards) into `GenericEventRequest` (Protobuf/FlatBuffer) and send to Orchestrator.
    *   Subscribe to NATS topic (specified by Orchestrator) to receive commands (Step, Pause, `AgentActionInput` from AI).
    *   Update main loop to be driven by these external commands.

---

## 3. Key Technologies & Patterns

*   **Primary Language(s):** Rust
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks (Anticipated for Alpha):**
    *   `serde` (for configuration if Rust worker loads parts directly, or for internal structs).
    *   `rand` (for randomness in food spawning, initial agent states if needed).
    *   `prost` & `tonic` (for gRPC client implementation if sending events/registering via gRPC, and for Protobuf message handling).
    *   `flatbuffers` crate (for serializing `WorldStateUpdate` payloads).
    *   `protobuf` crate (Rust implementation, e.g., `rust-protobuf` or `prost` for messages).
    *   `nats.rs` or `async-nats` (for subscribing to NATS command topics).
    *   (Potential) `rayon` (for future parallelization within a tick).
    *   (Potential) An Entity Component System (ECS) crate - for evaluation in Beta if complexity warrants.
*   **Architectural Patterns Used (within this layer):**
    *   Stateful Simulation Loop.
    *   Entity Management (via `AgentManager`, `FoodManager`).
    *   Clear separation of state (Structs like `Agent`, `Cell`, `Grid`) and logic/systems (functions/methods that operate on them).
*   **Data Formats Handled (Internal):** Rust structs for agents, food, cells, grid. (External: Protobuf/FlatBuffers within `GenericEventRequest` for communication).

## 4. Interactions & Interfaces (Focus on Alpha `a0.5.Y.Z` Integration)

*   **Communication with Orchestration/Communication Layer (Go Orchestrator):**
    *   **Events Published (as `GenericEventRequest` payloads, sent via gRPC `ReportEvent` call to Orchestrator, or direct NATS publish if that pattern is chosen):**
        *   `event_type_key: "sim.world_state.v1"` (Payload: `WorldStateUpdate` FlatBuffer)
        *   `event_type_key: "sim.agent_observation.v1"` (Payload: `AgentObservation` Protobuf)
        *   `event_type_key: "sim.agent_reward.v1"` (Payload: `AgentReward` Protobuf)
        *   `event_type_key: "sim.agent_died.v1"` (Payload: `AgentDiedInfo` Protobuf)
        *   `event_type_key: "sim.agent_spawned.v1"` (Payload: `AgentSpawnedInfo` Protobuf)
    *   **Commands Received (via NATS subscription on a worker-specific topic, or gRPC stream/calls from Orchestrator):**
        *   `event_type_key: "orchestrator.control.step"` (Payload: number of ticks)
        *   `event_type_key: "orchestrator.control.pause"`
        *   `event_type_key: "orchestrator.control.resume"`
        *   `event_type_key: "orchestrator.control.stop_worker"`
        *   `event_type_key: "orchestrator.ai.action"` (Payload: `AgentAction` Protobuf for a specific agent)
        *   `event_type_key: "orchestrator.control.inject_agent"` (Payload: `InjectAgentCommand` Protobuf)
    *   **gRPC Calls Made to Orchestrator (Worker Client to Orchestrator Server):**
        *   `OrchestratorWorkerService.RegisterWorker()`: On startup.
        *   `OrchestratorWorkerService.ReportEvent()`: To send `GenericEventRequest` batches (if not using direct NATS publish from worker for events).
*   **Interaction with Configuration Management System:**
    *   Receives its initial configuration (world size, tick rate, food params, default agent traits, Orchestrator gRPC address, assigned NATS command topic) from the Go Orchestrator when spawned. This configuration originates from YAML files.
*   **Interaction with Logging Layer (Indirect):**
    *   The events it publishes to the Orchestrator are intended to be picked up by the Orchestrator and forwarded to the Logging Layer's NATS JetStream topic.
*   **Interaction with Monitoring & Alerting System (Indirect/Future):**
    *   Could expose a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint if run as a long-lived service, or publish metric-specific events via Orchestrator. For Alpha, primary metrics might come from Orchestrator observing worker behavior.

## 5. Data Management & State

*   **Persistent State:** None directly managed by this layer. All configuration comes from external files or the Orchestrator. Simulation state is ephemeral per run unless explicitly saved (which would be a higher-level function via Orchestrator/Logging).
*   **In-Memory State:**
    *   The entire state of the simulation world:
        *   `WorldGrid` data.
        *   List/map of all `Agent` structs/entities and their properties.
        *   List/map of all `FoodPellet` structs/entities.
    *   Current simulation tick count.
*   **Data Consistency:** Handled by single-threaded updates per tick within each Rust worker process. If multi-threading is used *within* a worker (e.g., for parallel agent updates), Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, along with appropriate synchronization primitives (mutexes, channels), will be used to ensure data consistency.

---

## 6. Scalability & Performance Considerations

*   **Expected Load:** Potentially hundreds to thousands of agents, each performing actions and requiring observation generation every few ticks. Goal is to achieve many simulation ticks per second.
*   **Potential Bottlenecks:**
    *   Observation generation (spatial queries, iterating many entities).
    *   Collision detection / interaction resolution if N-squared complexity is not avoided.
    *   Updating many agent states per tick.
    *   Serialization of large world state updates.
*   **Strategies for Scaling/Performance:**
    *   Efficient data structures for spatial queries (e.g., quadtrees, spatial hashing if grid becomes very large, or if not using ECS that handles this).
    *   Optimized Rust code, minimizing allocations in the hot loop.
    *   Consider ECS pattern for cache-friendly iteration and data layout.
    *   Parallelize agent updates or grid region updates using Rayon or other multi-threading approaches *within* a worker if a single worker needs more CPU power.
    *   Multiple Rust worker processes (orchestrated by Go) for different simulation runs or (much more complex) for simulating different spatial partitions of a single, very large world.
*   **Memory Usage:** Proportional to the number of agents and food items. Structs should be kept as compact as possible.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy (Aligned with Alpha Roadmap `a0.4.Y.Z` and `a0.5.Y.Z`)

*   **Unit Tests (`a0.4.1t` - `a0.4.7t`):** For `Grid`, `Cell`, `Agent`, `FoodPellet`, `AgentManager`, `FoodManager`, `SimulationClock`, individual mechanics, observation/action generation.
*   **Integration Tests (Intra-layer - `a0.4.1.6`, `a0.4.4.4`, `a0.4.5.6`, `a0.4.6.6`, `a0.4.7.5`):** Testing components within the Rust simulation working together (e.g., AgentManager + Grid, full internal perceive-act cycle stubs).
*   **Integration Tests (Inter-layer - `a0.5.Y.Zt` tasks):**
    *   Testing Rust gRPC client connecting to a mock Orchestrator server.
    *   Testing Rust NATS subscriber receiving commands from a mock Orchestrator publisher.
    *   Verifying correct serialization and packaging of events into `GenericEventRequest` for sending.
*   **Performance Tests (Benchmarks - part of `a0.12.2.2`):** Benchmark tick processing time under various loads.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements / Open Questions

*   **More Complex Environment:** Obstacles, different terrain types affecting movement/vision.
*   **More Agent Senses:** Sound, smell.
*   **Agent Reproduction Mechanics:**
*   **Disease Mechanics:**
*   **Spatial Partitioning:** For running a single massive simulation across multiple Rust workers (very complex).
*   **Adoption of a full ECS Framework:** Evaluate if a library like `bevy_ecs` or `specs` provides significant benefits over custom struct management as complexity grows.
*   **Deterministic Floating Point:** If strict determinism is required across different hardware, careful handling of floating-point operations might be needed.
*   **Refine communication pattern with Orchestrator:** Is primary event stream via gRPC to Orchestrator better, or direct NATS publish from worker (with Orchestrator just managing control plane)? (Alpha `a0.5` assumes gRPC for events to Orchestrator, NATS for commands from Orchestrator).
