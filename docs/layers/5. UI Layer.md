# 5. UI Layer - Design Document

**Version:** 2 (Revised for Alpha Roadmap Alignment)
**Last Updated:** 5/10/2025

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

*   The User Interface (UI) Layer, implemented initially in **Python** (potentially with Pygame), provides a real-time visual representation of the Fish Eco Sim simulation and allows users to interact with and control the simulation.
*   Its primary role is to display the state of the 2D grid world, the agents, food, and other entities, updating dynamically as the simulation progresses. It also presents controls for managing the simulation (start, pause, speed, etc.) and for inspecting simulation data.
*   Key goals include: clear and smooth visualization, responsive user controls, providing insightful information to the user, and being decoupled from the core simulation logic by interacting solely with the Go Orchestration Layer.

---

## 2. Core Components & Functionality (Targeted for Alpha PoC `a0.10.Y.Z`)

*   **Main Application Window/Loop (e.g., Pygame loop - Target: `a0.10.1.Z`):**
    *   Initializes the Pygame display, manages window properties based on configuration.
    *   Runs the main Pygame event loop, processing user input (mouse, keyboard) and triggering updates.
    *   Manages the overall frame rate and drawing cycle.
*   **Simulation View Renderer (Target: `a0.10.1.Z` for world, `a0.10.2.Z` for entities):**
    *   Responsible for drawing the simulation state onto the Pygame screen.
    *   Draws the 2D grid lines.
    *   Renders cell properties like `depth` (as a color gradient) and `cell_type` (e.g., `OpenWater`, `SeaFloor`) using a pre-rendered background surface for performance.
    *   Renders `Agent` entities (e.g., as circles, color-coded by state/species_tag, showing direction) on top of the background.
    *   Renders `FoodPellet` entities on top of the background.
    *   (Future Beta) Renders other environmental elements (obstacles, plants).
    *   Handles visual representation of agent selection (e.g., highlight ring) and vision range (if selected and data is available).
*   **UI Control Panel / Elements (Target: `a0.10.3.Z`):**
    *   Implemented using a library like Pygame GUI or drawn manually within Pygame.
    *   **Buttons:** Start Simulation, Pause/Resume Simulation, Reset Simulation, Step Tick(s). (Add Agent button as a placeholder for Alpha).
    *   **Speed Control:** Placeholder for Alpha, full implementation in Beta.
    *   **Information Display Area:**
        *   Simulation statistics: Current tick count (from `WorldStateUpdate` or dedicated NATS event).
        *   Selected agent details: ID, position, energy (if this data is available from Orchestration Layer).
        *   (Future Beta) More detailed dropdowns, input fields.
*   **Input Handler (Target: `a0.10.3.Z`):**
    *   Processes Pygame events (mouse clicks on UI elements or grid, keyboard presses).
    *   Translates UI element interactions (button clicks) into commands to be sent to the Go Orchestration Layer.
    *   Handles agent selection via mouse clicks on the simulation grid area.
*   **State Manager (UI's internal view of the world - Target: `a0.10.1.Z`, `a0.10.2.Z`):**
    *   Maintains the UI's local Python data structures representing the latest received simulation state (agent positions/data, food positions/data, grid cell properties for background rendering, current tick).
    *   This state is updated asynchronously when new `WorldStateUpdate` (FlatBuffer) or other relevant messages arrive from the Go Orchestration Layer via NATS.
    *   This is the primary data source for the `Simulation View Renderer`.
*   **Communication Client (to Orchestration Layer - Target: `a0.10.1.Z` for NATS, `a0.10.3.Z` for gRPC):**
    *   Establishes and manages connections to the Go Orchestration Layer:
        *   NATS subscription (using `nats-py`) for receiving real-time `GenericEventRequest` messages (e.g., containing `WorldStateUpdate` FlatBuffers, AI/GA progress metrics).
        *   gRPC client (using `grpcio`) for sending user-initiated control commands to the Orchestration Layer.
    *   Deserializes incoming FlatBuffer and Protocol Buffer payloads.
    *   Serializes outgoing command payloads (Protocol Buffers).
*   **(Future Beta) Historical Data Playback Module:**
    *   Functionality to load and visualize simulation data from logged Apache Parquet files.

## 3. Key Technologies & Patterns

*   **Primary Language(s):** Python (initial Alpha/Beta version). (Future potential: C# with Avalonia UI or Unity for performance/feature enhancements).
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks (Python version for Alpha):**
    *   **Pygame:** For window creation, event loop, 2D graphics rendering, input handling.
    *   **Pygame GUI (pygame_gui):** (Recommended) For easier creation of UI elements like buttons, text displays.
    *   `nats-py`: For subscribing to NATS event streams from the Orchestration Layer.
    *   `grpcio` & `protobuf`: For gRPC communication (sending commands) and Protocol Buffer message handling.
    *   `flatbuffers` Python library: For efficient zero-copy access to `WorldStateUpdate` FlatBuffer payloads during rendering.
    *   `PyYAML`: For loading its own UI-specific configuration (e.g., window size, color themes).
*   **Architectural Patterns Used (within this layer):**
    *   Event-Driven Architecture (reacting to user input and NATS messages).
    *   Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Presenter (MVP) adaptation:
        *   Model: UI's internal `State Manager` holding simulation data.
        *   View: Pygame rendering functions and UI elements.
        *   Controller/Presenter: `Input Handler` and logic connecting UI actions to outgoing commands and NATS message callbacks updating the model.
*   **Data Formats Handled (Internal):** Python objects/dictionaries for UI state, agent/food display properties. Direct access to FlatBuffer byte arrays for rendering.

## 4. Interactions & Interfaces (Focus on Alpha `a0.10.Y.Z` Integration)

*   **Communication with Go Orchestration Layer / Communication Layer (via NATS for events, gRPC for commands):**
    *   **Events/Data Subscribed To (via NATS, as `GenericEventRequest` payloads from Orchestration Layer):**
        *   `event_type_key: "sim.world_state.v1"` (from `a0.2.2.1`)
            *   Description: Snapshot of world state for rendering (contains grid cell data, agent data, food data).
            *   Expected Payload Schema: `WorldStateUpdate` FlatBuffer.
        *   (Potentially) `event_type_key: "sim.agent_details.v1"`
            *   Description: Detailed info for a selected agent (if not part of `WorldStateUpdate`).
            *   Expected Payload Schema: `AgentFullDetails` Protocol Buffer.
        *   (Potentially) `event_type_key: "sim.stats_update.v1"`
            *   Description: Global simulation statistics.
            *   Expected Payload Schema: `SimulationStats` Protocol Buffer.
        *   `event_type_key: "metrics.ai.training_summary"` (from `a0.10.4.Z`)
        *   `event_type_key: "metrics.ga.generation_summary"` (from `a0.10.4.Z`)
    *   **Commands Published (via gRPC to Orchestration Layer's `OrchestratorClientService`):**
        *   RPC method for `StartSimulationCommand` (payload: simulation config name/ID).
        *   RPC method for `ControlSimulationCommand` (payload: `simulation_id`, command type like `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `STEP_N_TICKS`, parameters).
        *   (Alpha Placeholder) `command_key: "ui.control.add_agent.v1"` (actual implementation deferred).
*   **Interaction with Configuration Management System:**
    *   Reads its own UI-specific configuration (e.g., default window size, color schemes, NATS/gRPC addresses for Orchestration Layer) from YAML files, potentially edited by the `a0.1`/`a0.11` Config Editor tool.
*   **Interaction with Logging Layer (Indirectly, for Future Beta - Historical Playback):**
    *   The future "Historical Data Playback Module" would read Apache Parquet files generated by the Logging Layer.
*   **Interaction with Monitoring & Alerting System:**
    *   Primarily a consumer of high-level status; unlikely to expose many metrics itself beyond FPS or UI error counts.

## 5. Data Management & State

*   **Persistent State:**
    *   UI layout preferences or settings (if any, stored locally or via Configuration Management System).
*   **In-Memory State:**
    *   The latest received `WorldStateUpdate` data (containing grid cell properties, agent states, food states).
    *   State of UI elements (e.g., button states, selected agent ID).
    *   NATS/gRPC connection status to the Orchestration Layer.
*   **Data Consistency:** Displays the latest state received from the Orchestration Layer. Visual lag relative to true simulation state is possible due to network/processing latencies.

---

## 6. Scalability & Performance Considerations

*   **Rendering Performance (Key Focus for `a0.10.1.Z`):**
    *   Efficient drawing of static background (grid, cell depths/types) using a pre-rendered Pygame Surface.
    *   Efficient drawing of dynamic entities (agents, food) on top of this background.
    *   Targeting a stable frame rate (e.g., 30-60 FPS).
    *   Zero-copy access to `WorldStateUpdate` FlatBuffer data is critical.
*   **Event Handling:** Responsive to user input.
*   **Data Reception (NATS):** Efficiently processing incoming `WorldStateUpdate` messages.
*   **Potential Bottlenecks:**
    *   Re-rendering the entire static background too frequently (mitigated by pre-rendering).
    *   Drawing an extremely large number of dynamic entities individually if not optimized.
    *   Python's performance limits for very high entity counts if rendering logic becomes overly complex (potential driver for C# UI in future).
*   **Memory Usage:** Storing the pre-rendered background surface and the current `WorldStateUpdate` data.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy (Aligned with Alpha Roadmap `a0.10.Y.Z`)

*   **Unit Tests (`a0.10.1t` - `a0.10.4t` where applicable):**
    *   Test NATS/gRPC client communication logic (deserialization, command serialization).
    *   Test UI element logic (button state changes, mapping clicks to commands).
    *   Test logic for updating the UI's internal world state from received messages.
    *   Test helper functions for rendering (e.g., color mapping for depth).
*   **Integration Tests (Intra-layer):**
    *   Test interaction between input handling, UI element updates, and command generation.
*   **Integration Tests (Inter-layer via Mocks):**
    *   Connect UI to a mock Orchestration Layer.
    *   Send mock `WorldStateUpdate` messages via NATS and verify UI updates its internal state (visual output often requires manual verification).
    *   Simulate UI button clicks and verify correct gRPC commands are sent to the mock Orchestration Layer.
*   **Manual/Exploratory Testing (`a0.10.1.6`, `a0.10.2.3`, `a0.10.4.2`):** Essential for verifying visual correctness, usability, responsiveness, and overall E2E functionality with a live backend.

## 8. Future Enhancements / Open Questions

*   **Advanced Visualizations:** Heatmaps, agent trails, in-UI graphing.
*   **Camera Controls:** Pan, zoom.
*   **More Sophisticated UI Controls:** Custom widgets, theming, full implementation of "Add Agent."
*   **Historical Data Playback Feature (Beta target).**
*   **Accessibility Features.**
*   **Porting to C# (e.g., Avalonia UI or Unity) for performance/feature enhancements if Python version hits limitations.**
*   **How to handle very high-frequency `WorldStateUpdate` messages from the Orchestration Layer to maintain UI responsiveness?** (e.g., UI renders latest available, potentially skipping intermediate states if it falls behind).
