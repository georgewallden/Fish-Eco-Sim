# 9. Experiment Management System - Design Document

**Version:** 2 (Revised for Alpha Roadmap Alignment)
**Last Updated:** 5/10/2025

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

*   The Experiment Management System (EMS), primarily implemented in **Python**, provides tools and processes for defining, executing, and tracking collections of related Fish Eco Sim simulation runs, referred to as "experiments."
*   Its primary role is to automate the process of running simulations with varying configurations, parameters, or initial conditions, and to link these experimental setups with their resulting data from the Logging Layer for later analysis. This is crucial for systematic parameter sweeps, Reinforcement Learning hyperparameter tuning, A/B testing different simulation features, and providing the execution framework for the Evolution Engine.
*   Key goals include: enabling reproducible experiments, simplifying the setup of complex multi-run studies, managing the execution flow via the Go Orchestration Layer, and facilitating the organization and retrieval of experiment configurations and their associated results.

---

## 2. Core Components & Functionality (Targeted for Alpha PoC `a0.6.Y.Z` for basic CLI/scripting)

*   **Experiment Definition Format (YAML or JSON - Target: `a0.6.1.Z`):**
    *   A structured file format (e.g., `experiment_plan.yaml`) to define an experiment.
    *   **Contents:**
        *   `experiment_name` / `experiment_id`.
        *   `description`.
        *   `base_config_file_path`: Path to a base YAML configuration file (from the Configuration Management System).
        *   `parameter_space`: Defines parameters to vary and their values/ranges (e.g., grid search, list of specific combinations).
        *   `num_replicates_per_run`: Number of times to repeat each unique parameter combination (using different Random Number Generator seeds).
        *   (Future Beta) `execution_sequence`: For complex plans involving sequential steps or interventions.
        *   (Future Beta) `metrics_to_track`: Pointers to key metrics for results summary.
*   **Python Experiment Execution Engine/Script (Target: `a0.6.1.Z` for parsing, `a0.6.3.Z` for execution):**
    *   Reads an experiment definition file.
    *   **Job Generation:** Translates the `parameter_space` and `num_replicates_per_run` into a list of individual "simulation jobs." Each job has a fully specified configuration (base configuration merged with parameter overrides) and a unique `simulation_id`.
    *   **Job Orchestration (via Go Orchestration Layer):** For each job:
        1.  Constructs the final YAML configuration data for that specific run.
        2.  Sends a "Start Simulation" command (e.g., `StartSimulationCommand` Protocol Buffer) to the **Go Orchestration Layer** via its gRPC interface, including the specific configuration and the unique `simulation_id`.
        3.  (Alpha) Logs submission status. (Future Beta) Monitors the status of submitted simulation runs.
        4.  (Alpha) Sequential submission. (Future Beta) Manages concurrency of submitted jobs based on available resources reported by Orchestration Layer.
*   **Results Tracking & Association (Basic for Alpha - Target: `a0.6.3.Z`):**
    *   The EMS (via `run_experiment.py` script) records the parameters used for each generated `simulation_id` to a simple manifest file (e.g., CSV or JSON Lines).
    *   This mapping allows the **Statistical Interpretation / Analysis Layer** to later fetch the correct Apache Parquet log files for a given experimental run and correlate results with the input parameters.
    *   (Future Beta) Integration with dedicated experiment tracking tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases.
*   **Python Experiment Planner UI (Future Beta - not in Alpha `a0.6`):**
    *   A graphical user interface or enhanced Command Line Interface for creating/editing experiment definition files, defining parameter sweeps, and initiating execution.

---

## 3. Key Technologies & Patterns

*   **Primary Language(s):** Python (for execution engine and future UI).
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks (Anticipated for Alpha):**
    *   `PyYAML` or `ruamel.yaml` (for reading/writing experiment plans and configurations).
    *   `itertools` (Python standard library, for generating parameter combinations).
    *   `argparse` or `click` (for the `run_experiment.py` CLI).
    *   `grpcio` & `protobuf` (Python libraries for gRPC communication with the Go Orchestration Layer).
    *   (Future Beta) `mlflow`, `wandb` (clients for experiment tracking platforms).
*   **Architectural Patterns Used:**
    *   Batch Processing (of simulation jobs).
    *   Parameter Sweep.
    *   Workflow/Pipeline (defining a sequence of simulation runs).
*   **Data Formats Handled:** YAML or JSON (for experiment definitions). (Internal: Python dictionaries/lists for jobs and parameters).

## 4. Interactions & Interfaces (Focus on Alpha `a0.6.Y.Z` integration)

*   **Interaction with Go Orchestration Layer (`a0.3.Y.Z`):**
    *   **Publishes/Sends (via gRPC to `OrchestratorClientService`):** `StartSimulationCommand` Protocol Buffer messages, each containing a unique `simulation_id` and the complete configuration for that specific run.
    *   **Subscribes/Receives (via gRPC or NATS - Future Beta):** Potentially status updates from the Orchestration Layer about simulation runs (e.g., `sim.run_completed`, `sim.run_failed`). For Alpha, this might be limited to synchronous gRPC response.
*   **Interaction with Configuration Management System (`a0.1.Y.Z`, `a0.11.Y.Z`):**
    *   **Reads:** Base YAML configuration files to be used as templates for experiments.
*   **Interaction with Logging Layer (`a0.7.Y.Z`) & Statistical Interpretation / Analysis Layer (`a0.X_Analysis`):**
    *   The EMS enables their use by ensuring each simulation run it initiates has a unique `simulation_id` that will be present in the logs generated by the Logging Layer.
    *   The EMS stores the mapping of `simulation_id` to experimental parameters, which the Statistical Interpretation / Analysis Layer uses to correlate results.
*   **Interaction with Evolution Engine (`a0.9.Y.Z`):**
    *   The Evolution Engine will be a primary user of the EMS, instructing it to run batches of simulations for evaluating the fitness of different genomes. The Evolution Engine will generate the "experiment plans" for these evaluations.

---

## 5. Data Management & State

*   **Persistent State:**
    *   Experiment definition files (YAML/JSON), version controlled.
    *   Manifest files (e.g., CSV, JSON Lines) mapping `experiment_id`/`run_id_suffix` to specific parameters and the resulting `simulation_id`(s).
*   **In-Memory State (during execution by `run_experiment.py`):**
    *   The parsed experiment plan.
    *   The list of generated simulation jobs.
    *   Status of job submissions to the Orchestration Layer.

---

## 6. Scalability & Performance Considerations

*   **Number of Runs:** Experiments can generate hundreds or thousands of individual simulation runs.
*   **Execution Engine Performance:** Needs to efficiently parse plans, generate job configurations, and submit them to the Orchestration Layer.
*   **Concurrency Management (Future Beta):** Managing parallel submission of jobs to the Orchestration Layer based on available worker capacity.
*   **Tracking Large Numbers of Experiments:** The manifest files or future experiment tracking database needs to handle records for many experiments and runs.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy (Aligned with Alpha Roadmap `a0.6.Y.Z`)

*   **Unit Tests (`a0.6.1t`, `a0.6.2t`):**
    *   Test experiment plan parsing logic (YAML/JSON to Python objects).
    *   Test job generation logic (verifying correct parameter combinations and config overrides from base config).
    *   Test gRPC client logic for sending `StartSimulationCommand` to a mock Orchestration Layer.
*   **Integration Tests (Intra-layer - part of `a0.6.3t`):**
    *   Test the full flow within `run_experiment.py` from reading an experiment plan file to generating a sequence of job configurations and attempting to submit them (with a mocked Orchestration Layer client).
*   **Integration Tests (Inter-layer via Mocks/Live Orchestrator - `a0.6.3.2`):**
    *   Test the `run_experiment.py` script's ability to correctly send `StartSimulation` commands to a running (or comprehensively mocked) Go Orchestration Layer.
    *   Verify the Orchestration Layer receives the requests with the correct configurations.
*   **End-to-End Test (Simple Experiment - part of `a0.6.3.2`):**
    *   Define a very simple experiment plan.
    *   Run it through `run_experiment.py` against a live (Alpha version) Go Orchestration Layer that spawns stubbed/simple Rust Simulation Workers.
    *   Verify the manifest file logs the correct `simulation_id`s and parameters.

## 8. Future Enhancements / Open Questions

*   **Full GUI for Experiment Planning & Monitoring (Beta target).**
*   **Full Integration with MLflow/Weights & Biases:** For robust tracking of parameters, metrics, artifacts, and results comparison, replacing simple manifest files.
*   **More Sophisticated Parameter Space Definitions:** Support for conditional parameters, random search, Bayesian optimization.
*   **Resource-Aware Scheduling & Parallel Execution:** More intelligent scheduling of jobs based on actual availability of Simulation Workers.
*   **Ability to Pause/Resume/Cancel entire experiments gracefully via Orchestration Layer.**
*   **Distributed Experiment Execution Engine:** If the EMS itself needs to manage an extremely large number of concurrent submissions.
