# 8. Configuration Management System - Design Document

**Version:** 2 (Revised for Alpha Roadmap Alignment)
**Last Updated:** 5/10/2025

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

*   The Configuration Management System provides a centralized and user-friendly way to define, store, manage, and distribute all configuration parameters required by the various layers and services of the Fish Eco Sim project. It primarily consists of **YAML files** and a **Python-based UI tool ("Config Editor")**.
*   Its primary role is to ensure that simulations and system components (Simulation Layer, Orchestration Layer, Agent Intelligence Layer, UI Layer, Logging Layer, etc.) are initialized with correct and consistent parameters. It facilitates easy modification of these parameters for experimentation and supports reproducibility by enabling version control of configurations.
*   Key goals include: human-readability of configuration files (YAML), a user interface for easy editing and validation, version control for configurations via Git, and a standardized way for all services (Rust, Go, Python components) to load their respective configurations.

---

## 2. Core Components & Functionality (Targeted for Alpha PoC `a0.1.Y.Z` and V2 enhancements in `a0.11.Y.Z`)

*   **Configuration File Standard (YAML - Target: `a0.1.2.Z` for initial definition):**
    *   All configurations are stored in YAML (`.yaml` or `.yml`) files.
    *   A hierarchical structure is used within YAML files to organize parameters by layer/service (e.g., `simulation_worker_config`, `agent_intelligence_config`).
    *   Example structure for a simulation run configuration:
        ```yaml
        simulation_id: "alpha_run_001"
        description: "Initial test run with default agent settings"

        orchestration_layer_settings:
          nats_address: "nats://localhost:4222"
          # ... other orchestrator params

        simulation_layer_params: # To be passed to Rust Simulation Worker
          world_settings:
            width: 512
            height: 512
          # ... other simulation params

        agent_intelligence_layer_params: # For Python Agent Intelligence service
          learning_rate: 0.001
          # ... other AI params
        # ... sections for UI Layer, Logging Layer, etc.
        ```
*   **Python Configuration UI Tool ("Config Editor" - Basic: `a0.1.Y.Z`, V2: `a0.11.Y.Z`):**
    *   A standalone desktop application (e.g., built with Tkinter, PyQt).
    *   **Basic Functionality (Alpha `a0.1`):**
        *   Load existing YAML configuration files (`a0.1.1.Z`).
        *   Display parameters in a basic structured way (e.g., tree view or simple forms) (`a0.1.3.Z`).
        *   Allow editing of basic scalar values (strings, numbers, booleans) (`a0.1.3.Z`).
        *   Save modified configurations back to YAML files (`a0.1.1.Z`).
    *   **V2 Enhancements (Alpha `a0.11`):**
        *   **Schema Validation (`a0.11.1.Z`):** Validate inputs against a predefined JSON Schema. Display errors.
        *   **Enhanced UI for Complex Structures (`a0.11.2.Z`):** Better handling of nested dictionaries, lists (add/remove items).
        *   **Configuration Templates & Defaults (`a0.11.3.Z`):** Create new configs from templates, reset values to schema defaults.
        *   (Future Beta) Compare different configuration files.
*   **Configuration Schema Definition (Target: `a0.11.1.Z` for formalization):**
    *   A formal schema (e.g., JSON Schema files, or derived from Pydantic models if Config Editor uses them) describes all valid configuration parameters, their types (string, integer, float, boolean, enum), constraints (min/max values, allowed values), default values, and descriptions.
    *   Used by the Config Editor (V2) for validation and could be used by individual services for stricter startup validation.
*   **Configuration Loading Libraries (in each service - Target: Initial setup in each service's first Alpha milestone, e.g., `a0.3.1.2`, `a0.4.1.1` for config path):**
    *   Each service (Rust Simulation Layer, Go Orchestration Layer, Python services) uses its respective language's YAML parsing library to load its relevant section from the provided configuration file(s) at startup.
*   **Version Control for Configurations (Practice established from `a0.1.Y.Z`):**
    *   YAML configuration files are stored in a Git repository for tracking changes, history, and branching.

## 3. Key Technologies & Patterns

*   **Primary Language(s) (for Config Editor UI tool):** Python
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks:**
    *   **YAML:** The core file format.
    *   **Python Config Editor UI Tool:**
        *   `PyYAML` or `ruamel.yaml` (for YAML parsing/emission).
        *   GUI Toolkit: `Tkinter` (Alpha initial), `PyQt`/`PySide` (potential for V2 or Beta).
        *   `jsonschema` (Python, for schema validation in V2).
        *   (Potentially) `Pydantic` (Python, for data validation/settings management, can auto-generate JSON Schema).
    *   **Service-side YAML Parsers:**
        *   Go (Orchestration Layer): `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` or `v3`.
        *   Rust (Simulation Layer): `serde_yaml` (used with `serde`).
*   **Architectural Patterns Used:**
    *   Centralized Configuration Files (as the source of truth).
    *   Configuration Provider (the UI tool facilitates creating/editing these files).
    *   Schema-based Validation (for V2).
*   **Data Formats Handled:** YAML. (Internal to UI: Python objects/dictionaries. Schema: JSON Schema).

## 4. Interactions & Interfaces

*   **Interaction with All Service Layers (Simulation, Orchestration, Agent Intelligence, UI, Logging, Experiment Management, Evolution Engine, Monitoring & Alerting):**
    *   All layers **read** their specific configuration parameters from YAML files at startup.
    *   The Go Orchestration Layer is often responsible for reading a master configuration and passing the relevant `simulation_worker_config` subset to each Rust Simulation Worker it spawns.
*   **Interaction with Users (via Python Config Editor UI Tool):**
    *   Users interact with the UI tool to create, view, modify, and (in V2) validate YAML configuration files.
*   **Interaction with Version Control System (Git):**
    *   YAML configuration files are committed to Git.

---

## 5. Data Management & State

*   **Persistent State:** The YAML configuration files stored on disk and managed under version control (Git). Schemas (e.g., JSON Schema files) are also version controlled.
*   **In-Memory State (within Config Editor UI Tool):** The currently loaded and edited configuration data (e.g., as a Python dictionary) before it is saved back to a YAML file.

---

## 6. Scalability & Performance Considerations

*   **Config Editor UI Tool Performance:** Should be responsive for loading and editing moderately sized YAML files. Efficient parsing and UI rendering are needed for larger files.
*   **Service Startup Time:** Fast parsing of YAML files by individual services is desirable. Standard libraries are generally efficient.
*   **Scalability of Configurations:** The system should handle a growing number of parameters. A hierarchical file structure or include-mechanisms in YAML might be needed for very complex setups (Future Beta).

---

## 7. Testing Strategy (Aligned with Alpha Roadmap `a0.1.Y.Z` and `a0.11.Y.Z`)

*   **Unit Tests (for Config Editor UI Tool - `a0.1.1t`, `a0.1.3t`, `a0.11.1t`, `a0.11.2t`, `a0.11.3t`):**
    *   YAML loading and saving logic.
    *   Parameter validation logic against schemas (for V2).
    *   UI widget interaction logic (mocked where necessary).
    *   Template loading and default value application (for V2).
*   **Unit Tests (for Service Configuration Loading):**
    *   Each service (Rust, Go, Python) should have unit tests for parsing valid and invalid configuration snippets it expects, and for handling default values.
*   **Schema Validation Tests (`a0.11.1t`):**
    *   Ensure the defined configuration schema correctly identifies valid and invalid configurations.
*   **Manual Testing (for Config Editor UI Tool):** Thoroughly test usability, correctness of editing, validation feedback, and file operations.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements / Open Questions

*   **Hierarchical/Layered Configurations (e.g., "includes" or overrides - Beta):** Allow base configurations to be overridden by more specific ones.
*   **Remote Configuration Service (Post-Alpha/Beta):** For very large distributed systems, a service like Consul or etcd might serve configurations (likely overkill for initial project scope).
*   **Dynamic Configuration Updates (Advanced - Post-Alpha/Beta):** Allowing some services to reload parts of their configuration without a full restart.
*   **Closer Integration between Config Editor and Experiment Management System:** The Experiment Management UI might use components of the Config Editor for defining parameter variations.
*   **Programmatic Configuration Generation Scripts:** For creating very large or systematically varied sets of configurations.
