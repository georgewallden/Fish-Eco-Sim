# 6. Logging Layer - Design Document

**Version:** 2 (Revised for Alpha Roadmap Alignment)
**Last Updated:** 5/10/2025

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

*   The Logging Layer, implemented in **Python**, is responsible for capturing, structuring, and persistently storing all relevant events and data generated during Fish Eco Sim simulation runs.
*   Its primary role is to create a comprehensive historical record of simulations. This data is essential for offline statistical analysis, debugging complex emergent behaviors, calculating fitness for the Evolution Engine, and potentially enabling simulation playback features.
*   Key goals include: reliable and eventually consistent data capture with minimal performance impact on the live simulation, storing data in an efficient and queryable format (Apache Parquet), ensuring source timestamps from events are preserved for temporal accuracy, and scalability to handle high volumes of event data.

---

## 2. Core Components & Functionality (Targeted for Alpha PoC `a0.7.Y.Z`)

*   **Event Subscriber (NATS JetStream Client - Target: `a0.7.1.Z`):**
    *   A Python process that subscribes to one or more durable NATS JetStream topics (e.g., `logging.events.raw`) where the Go Orchestration Layer publishes `GenericEventRequest` messages intended for logging.
    *   Handles deserialization of the outer `GenericEventRequest` Protocol Buffer wrapper. The inner `event_payload` (FlatBuffer or Protocol Buffer bytes) is typically kept serialized until written to Apache Parquet or during analysis.
    *   Manages message acknowledgments with NATS JetStream to ensure at-least-once delivery.
*   **Data Batching & Buffering (Target: `a0.7.2.Z`):**
    *   Collects incoming processed `GenericEventRequest` data (key fields + raw payload) into in-memory batches.
    *   Batching criteria: number of messages, time interval, or total size of buffered data.
*   **Structured Data Formatter / Parquet Writer (Target: `a0.7.2.Z`):**
    *   Transforms batches of processed event data into a tabular structure suitable for Apache Parquet.
    *   Key columns: `timestamp_ns` (from `GenericEventRequest`), `event_type_key`, `worker_id`, `simulation_id`, `payload_format_hint`, `event_payload` (binary).
    *   Uses libraries like `pyarrow` (often via Pandas) to write to Apache Parquet files.
*   **Log File Management (Target: `a0.7.3.Z`):**
    *   Organizes Apache Parquet files on disk (or cloud object storage).
    *   File naming convention includes `simulation_id`, date, and sequence/timestamp components.
    *   Example: `/logs/{simulation_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{HH}/{timestamp_or_sequence}.parquet`
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   Manages NATS connection issues (reconnect logic).
    *   Handles errors during data processing or Parquet writing (e.g., logging errors to its own operational log, potentially using a dead-letter queue in NATS for unprocessable messages).

---

## 3. Key Technologies & Patterns

*   **Primary Language(s):** Python
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks (Anticipated for Alpha):**
    *   `nats-py` (for subscribing to NATS JetStream).
    *   `protobuf` (Python library for deserializing `GenericEventRequest`).
    *   `flatbuffers` (Python library, though payload bytes are often stored directly).
    *   `pyarrow` (for writing Apache Parquet files).
    *   `pandas` (optional, for structuring data before writing to Parquet).
    *   `PyYAML` (for loading its own configuration).
    *   Python standard library (`logging` for operational logs, `datetime`, `os`).
*   **Architectural Patterns Used (within this layer):**
    *   Asynchronous Event Consumer.
    *   Batch Processing.
    *   Data Pipeline (Intake -> Batch -> Format -> Store).
*   **Data Formats Handled (Output):** Apache Parquet. (Input: Protocol Buffer `GenericEventRequest` containing various `event_payload` types).

## 4. Interactions & Interfaces (Focus on Alpha `a0.7.Y.Z` integration)

*   **Communication with Orchestration Layer / Communication Layer (via NATS JetStream):**
    *   **Events/Data Subscribed To:**
        *   NATS JetStream topic(s) like `logging.events.raw` (defined in `a0.2.2.1`).
        *   Receives `GenericEventRequest` messages published by the Go Orchestration Layer.
*   **Interaction with Configuration Management System:**
    *   Reads its operational configuration from YAML files (managed by `a0.1`/`a0.11` Config Editor).
    *   Example Parameters: NATS server URL, NATS JetStream topic(s), batching parameters, Apache Parquet output directory/path template.
*   **Interaction with Statistical Interpretation / Analysis Layer:**
    *   This layer *produces* the Apache Parquet data that the Statistical Interpretation / Analysis Layer consumes. No direct runtime interaction.
*   **Interaction with Monitoring & Alerting System:**
    *   Exposes metrics (e.g., messages processed/sec, batch write times, NATS consumer lag) via a Prometheus endpoint.
    *   May publish alerts for critical logging failures (e.g., NATS connection loss, persistent Parquet write failures) to a NATS topic for the Alerting Service.

## 5. Data Management & State

*   **Persistent State:**
    *   The Apache Parquet files themselves, constituting the historical log of simulation events.
    *   NATS JetStream consumer state (e.g., last acknowledged message) is managed by NATS itself.
*   **In-Memory State:**
    *   Current batch of `GenericEventRequest` data being collected.
    *   NATS connection object and subscription state.
*   **Data Consistency:**
    *   Eventual consistency: Logs are written asynchronously.
    *   Source `timestamp_ns` within each event ensures temporal ordering for analysis.
    *   At-least-once delivery semantics from NATS JetStream (with proper acknowledgments).

---

## 6. Scalability & Performance Considerations

*   **Expected Load:** High volume of events from multiple concurrent Simulation Workers (via Orchestration Layer).
*   **Potential Bottlenecks:**
    *   Python processing speed for deserialization/batching if not optimized (keep pre-batch transformations minimal).
    *   I/O throughput for writing Apache Parquet files.
    *   NATS JetStream consumer performance.
*   **Strategies for Scaling/Performance:**
    *   Efficient batching.
    *   (Future Beta) Asynchronous I/O for Parquet writing (e.g., `aiofiles`).
    *   (Future Beta) Multiple Logging Service instances using NATS queue groups or data partitioning.
    *   Optimized Apache Parquet writing parameters (compression, row group sizes).
*   **Memory Usage:** Primarily for in-memory event batches.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy (Aligned with Alpha Roadmap `a0.7.Y.Z`)

*   **Unit Tests (`a0.7.1t` - `a0.7.3t`):** NATS connection/subscription logic, `GenericEventRequest` deserialization, batching logic, Parquet data structuring, Parquet writing functions, log file naming.
*   **Integration Tests (Intra-layer):** Test the internal pipeline: mock NATS messages -> batching -> Parquet writing -> verify Parquet content.
*   **Integration Tests (Inter-layer via Live NATS - `a0.7.4.Z`):**
    *   Have a mock publisher (simulating Go Orchestration Layer) send `GenericEventRequest` messages to a test NATS JetStream topic.
    *   Verify the Logging Service consumes these and writes correct Apache Parquet files.
*   **Performance/Load Tests (part of `a0.12.2.2`):** Test with high message volumes to measure throughput and identify bottlenecks.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements / Open Questions

*   **Support for Multiple Output Sinks:** E.g., simultaneously writing to Apache Parquet and a Time-Series Database (TSDB) like InfluxDB.
*   **Schema Evolution for Logged Payloads:** Managing changes in the schema of `event_payload`s over time within the Parquet store.
*   **Data Archival & Tiering Strategies.**
*   **Direct Integration with Data Lake / Data Warehouse solutions.**
*   **Log Data Validation/Quality Checks.**
