# 3. Communication Layer - Design Document

**Version:** 2 (Revised for Alpha Roadmap Alignment)
**Last Updated:** 2/10/2025

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

*   The Communication Layer is not a single software component but rather the collection of technologies, protocols, message schemas, and architectural patterns that enable decoupled, efficient, and standardized interaction between all other layers of the Fish Eco Sim system.
*   Its primary role is to ensure that layers like the Simulation Layer (Rust), Orchestration Layer (Go), Agent Intelligence Layer (Python), UI Layer (Python), and Logging Layer (Python) can exchange data and commands without having direct, hard-coded dependencies on each other's internal implementations. It acts as the "nervous system" or "fabric" of the distributed application.
*   Key goals include: enabling loose coupling, supporting high-performance data exchange, ensuring message interoperability across Rust, Go, and Python, providing clear data contracts, and facilitating both synchronous request/response (via gRPC - gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) and asynchronous event-driven communication (via NATS).

---

## 2. Core Components & Functionality (Key Elements defined in Alpha `a0.2.Y.Z`)

*   **Message Schemas (Data Contracts - Target: `a0.2.1.Z`):**
    *   **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf):** Used for defining the structure of discrete events, commands, and smaller data payloads (e.g., `AgentAction`, `AgentDiedInfo`, `AgentObservation`, `AgentReward`). Schemas are defined in `.proto` files.
        *   **Alpha PoC Messages (`a0.2.1.1`, `a0.2.1.3`):** `GenericEventRequest`, `AgentAction`, `AgentObservation`, `AgentReward`, and other control/status messages.
    *   **FlatBuffers:** Used for defining the structure of large, high-frequency data snapshots, primarily the `WorldStateUpdate` from the Simulation Layer, to enable zero-copy access for consumers like the UI Layer. Schemas are defined in `.fbs` files.
        *   **Alpha PoC Message (`a0.2.1.2`):** `WorldStateUpdate`.
    *   **`GenericEventRequest` (Protobuf - `a0.2.1.1`):** The primary wrapper for most asynchronous event publications. Contains:
        *   `event_type_key` (string): Application-defined key (defined in `Schema_Registry.md`).
        *   `payload_format_hint` (string): E.g., "flatbuffer", "protobuf".
        *   `event_payload` (bytes): The actual serialized Protobuf or FlatBuffer data.
        *   `timestamp_ns` (int64): Source-generated nanosecond timestamp.
        *   Other metadata (e.g., `worker_id`, `simulation_id`).
*   **Transport Protocols & Messaging Systems:**
    *   **gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls - Interface Definitions Target: `a0.2.2.Z`):** Used for request/response interactions and server-side streaming.
        *   **Alpha PoC Use:** Orchestration Layer exposes gRPC services for Simulation Worker registration/event submission and for Client (UI Layer/Experiment Management System) control commands.
    *   **NATS (with NATS JetStream for persistence - Topic Structure Target: `a0.2.2.Z`):**
        *   **Core Publish-Subscribe:** Used as the primary message bus for asynchronous event distribution, managed/brokered by the Go Orchestration Layer.
        *   **Alpha PoC Use:** Routing `GenericEventRequest` messages to UI Layer, Agent Intelligence Layer, and Logging Layer via specific NATS topics. NATS JetStream used for the logging topic for durable message persistence.
*   **Architectural Pattern: Publish-Subscribe:**
    *   Central to the NATS usage, with the Go Orchestration Layer acting as the hub.
    *   Producers (mainly Simulation Workers via the Orchestration Layer) publish events without knowing the subscribers.
    *   Consumers (UI Layer, Agent Intelligence Layer, Logging Layer, Monitoring & Alerting System) subscribe to specific `event_type_key`s or NATS topics they are interested in.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization Libraries & Code Generation (Target: `a0.2.1.4`):**
    *   Each language (Rust, Go, Python) uses its respective libraries for Protocol Buffers and FlatBuffers.
    *   Build scripts/processes generate language-specific code from `.proto` and `.fbs` schema files.

---

## 3. Key Technologies & Patterns (Summary)

*   **Primary Language(s):** N/A (Defined by interacting layers: Rust, Go, Python)
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks (used by other layers):**
    *   Rust: `prost`, `tonic` (for gRPC & Protobuf), `flatbuffers` crate, `nats.rs` or `async-nats`.
    *   Go: `grpc-go`, `protobuf` (e.g., `gogo/protobuf` or official Google libraries), `google/flatbuffers/go`, `nats.go`.
    *   Python: `grpcio`, `protobuf`, `flatbuffers` library, `nats-py`.
*   **Architectural Patterns Used:** Publish-Subscribe, Message Queuing (via NATS JetStream), Request/Response (via gRPC), Data Contracts (via Protobuf/FlatBuffers), Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
*   **Data Formats Handled (on the wire):** Serialized Protobuf byte streams, Serialized FlatBuffer byte streams.

## 4. Interactions & Interfaces (Defined in Alpha `a0.2.Y.Z`)

*   **This layer *is* the definition of the interfaces for all other layers.**
*   **Message Definitions (`.proto`, `.fbs` files - Target `a0.2.1.Z`):**
    *   Canonical source for data structures. Stored in a version-controlled schema directory.
    *   **Alpha Key Messages:** `GenericEventRequest`, `WorldStateUpdate` (FlatBuffer), `AgentAction` (Protobuf), `AgentObservation` (Protobuf), `AgentReward` (Protobuf), `StartSimulationCommand` (Protobuf), `ControlSimulationCommand` (Protobuf), `WorkerRegistrationInfo` (Protobuf).
*   **gRPC Service Definitions (`.proto` files - Target `a0.2.2.2`, `a0.2.2.3`):**
    *   Define RPC methods, request types, and response types for synchronous communication.
    *   **Alpha Key Services (Exposed by Orchestration Layer):** `OrchestratorWorkerService` (for Simulation Workers), `OrchestratorClientService` (for UI Layer, Experiment Management System).
*   **NATS Topic Naming Conventions (Target `a0.2.2.1`):**
    *   A documented, hierarchical naming scheme (e.g., in `Schema_Registry.md`).
    *   **Alpha Examples:**
        *   `events.simulation.{sim_id}.world_state`
        *   `events.simulation.{sim_id}.agent.{agent_id}.observation`
        *   `commands.simulation_worker.{worker_id}.control`
        *   `logging.events.raw` (NATS JetStream topic)
*   **Standard `event_type_key` Strings (Documented in `Schema_Registry.md` - ongoing with `a0.2.1.Z` and as new events are defined):**
    *   Central registry for `event_type_key` strings, their meaning, version, and expected `event_payload` schema/format.
    *   **Alpha Examples:** `"sim.world_state.v1"`, `"sim.agent_observation.v1"`, `"ai.agent_action.v1"`.

## 5. Data Management & State

*   The Communication Layer itself is generally stateless, focusing on message transit and definition.
*   State related to message delivery (e.g., persistence, acknowledgments) is managed by the underlying messaging system (NATS JetStream).
*   State related to gRPC connections is managed by the gRPC libraries and the services implementing them.

---

## 6. Scalability & Performance Considerations

*   **Serialization Efficiency:** Choice of Protocol Buffers (good general efficiency) and FlatBuffers (excellent for zero-copy read access of large data) is key.
*   **Message Bus Performance (NATS):** NATS is designed for high throughput and low latency. NATS JetStream adds persistence with some performance trade-offs, which is acceptable for logging.
*   **gRPC Performance:** Generally very efficient for RPC.
*   **Network Bandwidth:** Payloads should be kept as concise as possible. Binary formats help.
*   **Connection Management:** Efficient handling of persistent connections (gRPC, NATS).
*   **Potential Bottlenecks:**
    *   Serialization/deserialization CPU cost in very high-frequency producers/consumers (though chosen formats are efficient).
    *   NATS server becoming a bottleneck if under-resourced or if topic fan-out is extremely wide with slow consumers on non-persistent topics.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy (Aligned with Alpha Roadmap `a0.2.Y.Z`)

*   **Schema Validation & Round-Trip Tests (`a0.2.1.5t`, `a0.2.1.5`):** Ensure generated code from Protocol Buffer/FlatBuffer schemas can correctly serialize/deserialize messages in Rust, Go, Python.
*   **gRPC Stub Compilation & Callability Tests (`a0.2.2.4t`, `a0.2.2.4`):** Verify that generated gRPC client/server stubs compile and basic (mocked) calls can be structured in all target languages.
*   **NATS Topic & Message Bus Integration Tests (part of higher-level service tests, e.g., `a0.3.4.2`, `a0.5.4.1`):** While not testing NATS itself, tests for services using NATS will verify that messages published to specific topics are correctly formatted and that subscriptions work as expected.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements / Open Questions

*   **Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd):** For very complex microservice deployments, a service mesh could provide advanced features like traffic management, observability, and security at the communication level (likely overkill for initial phases).
*   **Alternative Message Brokers:** While NATS is a strong choice, evaluating others (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) if specific needs arise.
*   **Schema Registry Tool:** For managing and evolving Protocol Buffer/FlatBuffer schemas in a large environment (e.g., Confluent Schema Registry).
*   **Formalizing `Schema_Registry.md` content and update process.**
