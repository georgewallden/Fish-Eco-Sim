# Fish Eco Sim - Full Version (GA) Roadmap (Conceptual Goals)

**Roadmap Revision:** 0.1 (Conceptual Outline)
**Last Updated:** 5/10/2025
**Prerequisite:** Successful completion of Beta Phase (e.g., `b1.X.Y.Z` target for V1.0 readiness).

## 1. Philosophy & Goals for Full Version / General Availability (GA)

The Full Version (or General Availability - GA) phase for Fish Eco Sim signifies a mature, stable, and feature-rich release of the platform, suitable for its intended primary uses (e.g., serious research, robust DRL experimentation, educational purposes, wider community use if applicable).

The transition from Beta to a Full Version (e.g., V1.0.0.0) is marked by:

1.  **High Stability & Reliability:**
    *   All critical and major bugs identified during Beta testing have been resolved.
    *   The system demonstrates consistent, predictable behavior under defined operational conditions and for extended periods.
    *   Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms are in place.
2.  **Feature Completeness (for the defined V1.0 scope):**
    *   All features planned for the "Version 1.0" milestone during the Beta phase are fully implemented, tested, and documented.
    *   This includes mature versions of the Simulation Engine, Agent Intelligence (DRL/MARL), Evolution Engine, UI, Experiment Management, Configuration Management, Logging, and Analysis tools.
3.  **Performance Targets Met:**
    *   The system meets or exceeds predefined performance benchmarks for key operations (e.g., simulation speed, AI training throughput, UI responsiveness) under typical and stress load conditions.
    *   Optimizations identified during Beta have been implemented.
4.  **Comprehensive & Polished Documentation:**
    *   User guides for all tools (UI, Config Editor, Experiment Manager).
    *   Developer documentation (API specifications, architectural documents, contribution guides) is complete, accurate, and accessible.
    *   Tutorials or example use cases may be provided.
5.  **User Experience (UX) Polish:**
    *   Interfaces (UI, tool UIs) are intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically refined to a level appropriate for the target audience.
6.  **Clear Release Definition:**
    *   A specific set of features and capabilities that constitute "Version 1.0" (or `V.0.0.0`) is clearly defined and achieved.

**What a Full Version IS:**
*   A version of the software that the development team considers complete and robust enough for its primary intended purpose and audience.
*   The culmination of the core development effort outlined in the Alpha and Beta phases.
*   A stable baseline upon which future major versions (V2.0, V3.0) or significant new feature branches can be built.

**What a Full Version (e.g., V1.0) might still NOT be:**
*   The "end" of development. Further improvements, new major features, or adaptations to new research questions will likely lead to V1.X.Y.Z (minor/patch releases) or V2.0.0.0.
*   Possessing every conceivable "stretch goal" feature that was ideated during earlier phases but deemed out of scope for the initial GA release.

**Versioning for Full Releases:**
Full versions will follow the `V.X.Y.Z` scheme (e.g., `1.0.0.0`, `1.1.0.0`, `1.1.1.0`) as defined in the `Versioning_Strategy.md` document, adhering to Semantic Versioning principles where:
*   `V`: Major version (breaking changes or significant new functionality).
*   `X`: Minor version (new features, backward-compatible).
*   `Y`: Patch version (bug fixes, backward-compatible).
*   `Z` (and optional `.i` build metadata): Finer-grained build/revision identifiers.

## 2. Post-V1.0 Development (Conceptual - Future Roadmap)

Once a stable V1.0.0.0 (or subsequent `V.0.0.0`) is released, future development will be planned in new roadmap documents. This might include:

*   **Minor Releases (`V.X.Y.Z` where X increments):**
    *   Adding significant new features or capabilities that build upon the stable GA core.
    *   Major enhancements to existing systems (e.g., a completely new type of AI, a different evolutionary paradigm, significant performance re-architecture).
*   **Patch Releases (`V.X.Y.Z` where Y increments):**
    *   Bundling bug fixes, smaller enhancements, and performance tweaks.
*   **New Major Versions (`V+1.0.0.0`):**
    *   If the platform undergoes substantial architectural changes, introduces paradigm shifts, or has extensive new functionalities that represent a major leap forward.

**Specific features beyond the initial GA release are TBD** and will be based on:
*   Experience gained from using the GA version.
*   New research questions or goals that emerge.
*   User/community feedback (if applicable).
*   Technological advancements in relevant fields (AI, simulation, distributed systems).

This conceptual outline provides a placeholder for thinking about "what comes after Beta." The detailed roadmap for any V1.X or V2.0 will be created when V1.0 is approaching completion or has been released.
