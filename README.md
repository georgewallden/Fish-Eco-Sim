# Fish Eco Sim - Emergent Ecosystem Simulation Platform

**Version:** Alpha `a0.0.0.0` (Initial Design & Planning Phase)
**Status:** In Active Design & Documentation Phase

---

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

Fish Eco Sim is a 2D emergent ecosystem simulation featuring fish-like agents in a grid-based ocean world. The ultimate goal is to create a system where complex behaviors (like predation, cooperation, adaptation, complex survival strategies) evolve over time from simple, predefined agent rules and traits interacting with their environment and each other.

This platform aims to serve as:
*   A research tool for studying artificial life, emergent behavior, and evolutionary dynamics.
*   An environment for training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with neural network "brains" to learn optimal survival and interaction strategies.
*   A highly modular and extensible framework for various types of agent-based simulations.

**Key Goals:**
*   **Emergence:** Observe complex, unplanned behaviors arising from simple rules.
*   **Evolution:** Implement mechanisms for agents to evolve traits and behaviors over generations.
*   **Learning:** Provide a robust environment for DRL agent training.
*   **Modularity:** Design a decoupled system where components can be developed, tested, and potentially replaced independently.
*   **Performance:** Enable fast simulation speeds to observe long-term dynamics and efficiently train AI.
*   **Extensibility:** Build a core framework that can be adapted for different simulation scenarios beyond the initial fish ecosystem.
*   **Insight & Analysis:** Provide comprehensive logging and tools for statistical analysis and visualization of simulation data.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The Fish Eco Sim platform is designed as a distributed, multi-language system with clear separation of concerns across several key layers:

*   **Simulation Layer (Rust):** The core "world engine" that executes simulation logic, manages entity state, and enforces rules.
*   **Orchestration Layer (Go):** Manages Simulation Worker lifecycles, acts as a central Publish-Subscribe hub for communication, and provides control APIs. Designed to be simulation-agnostic.
*   **Communication Layer (Pattern - NATS, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers):** Defines how all layers interact, ensuring decoupling and efficient data exchange.
*   **Agent Intelligence Layer (Python):** Hosts agent "brains," primarily Deep Reinforcement Learning neural networks (PyTorch/TensorFlow), and manages their training.
*   **UI Layer (Python, potentially C# later):** Provides real-time visualization and user interaction.
*   **Logging Layer (Python):** Captures all simulation events asynchronously for historical analysis, storing data in Apache Parquet format.
*   **Analysis Layer (Python):** Tools and scripts for offline statistical interpretation and visualization of logged data.
*   **Supporting Systems (Primarily Python):**
    *   Configuration Management System (YAML + UI Tool)
    *   Experiment Management System (Scripts/CLI + Plan Files)
    *   Evolution Engine (Genetic Algorithms)
    *   Monitoring & Alerting System (Prometheus, Grafana)
