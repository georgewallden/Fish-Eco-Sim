#
# Description:
# This section provides a high-level overview of the file's purpose,
# what components (classes, functions) it contains, and its role within
# the larger project structure. It explains the "why" behind this file's
# existence and what problem it solves or functionality it provides.
#
# Key responsibilities of this file:
# - [Responsibility 1]
# - [Responsibility 2]
# - ...
#
# Design Philosophy/Notes:
# [Any specific design choices, patterns, or assumptions made in this file.
# E.g., "Uses a data-driven approach", "Focuses on separation of concerns",
# "Handles all physics calculations for X"].

# Imports Description:
# This section lists the modules and packages that this file depends on.
# Each import is noted with a brief explanation of why it's needed for the
# functionality implemented in this file.
#
# - import some_standard_lib: Needed for [specific functionality, e.g., math operations, random numbers].
# - from some_package import SomeClass: Needed to [use instances of this class, inherit from it, etc.].
# - from . import another_module_in_this_package: Needed to [access functions or classes within the same package].
# - from ..some_other_package import AnotherClass: Needed to [interact with components in a different package].

# Code Block Descriptions:
# This section provides detailed blueprints for each major class, method,
# or standalone function implemented in this file. The descriptions are
# numbered sequentially and serve as the specification for the code that
# will appear later in the file.

# 1. Class: ClassName (if applicable)
# Description:
# Defines the structure and primary behavior of [ClassName]. This is a blueprint
# for creating objects of this type.
#
# Attributes (planned or key ones):
# - attribute_name: Type - [Description]
# ...
#
# Primary Role: [What objects of this class are responsible for]

# 1.1 Method: __init__ (if applicable, within ClassName)
# Description:
# Constructor for the ClassName. Initializes new instances with necessary
# starting values and sets up their initial state.
# Inputs:
#   - self: The instance being initialized (standard).
#   - input_param1: Type (Source: [Where it comes from, e.g., calling code, config], Constraints: [e.g., > 0, non-None], Notes: [Any other info])
#   - ...
# Where Inputs Typically Come From: [General source of initialization data].
# Restrictions on Inputs: [Any global constraints on inputs].
# Other Relevant Info: [Context for initialization].
#
# Description of Algorithm/Process:
# 1. [Step 1]
# 2. [Step 2]
# ...
#
# Description of Output:
# None (Constructors don't return a value; their output is the initialized 'self' object).
# State of 'self' after execution: [Describe the state of the object].

# 1.2 Method: methodName (if applicable, within ClassName)
# Description:
# [Detailed purpose of this method]. This method performs [specific action].
# Inputs:
#   - self: The instance the method is called on (standard).
#   - method_input1: Type (Source: [Where it comes from], Constraints: ..., Notes: ...)
#   - ...
# Where Inputs Typically Come From: [e.g., Called by the main loop, by another object's method].
# Restrictions on Inputs: [Specific constraints for this method].
# Other Relevant Info: [Context needed for this method's logic].
#
# Description of Algorithm/Process:
# 1. [Step 1: Explain what happens first]
# 2. [Step 2: Describe the next logical step, including any conditional logic or loops]
#    - If condition X: [Sub-steps]
#    - Else: [Alternative sub-steps]
# 3. [Step 3]
# ... (Be as detailed as needed to understand the logic without seeing the code)
#
# Description of Output:
# [What is returned by this method, or what side effect it produces].
# Type: [Return type, e.g., int, bool, list[Object], None].
# Output Range/Expected: [Typical or possible values, edge cases].
# Side Effects: [Any changes made to the object's state, other objects, or the environment].

# 2. Function: standalone_function (if applicable)
# Description:
# [Detailed purpose of this standalone function]. This function performs [specific action].
# Inputs:
#   - function_input1: Type (Source: ..., Constraints: ..., Notes: ...)
#   - ...
# Where Inputs Typically Come From: [e.g., Called by a class method, by main logic].
# Restrictions on Inputs: [Specific constraints for this function].
# Other Relevant Info: [Context needed for this function's logic].
#
# Description of Algorithm/Process:
# 1. [Step 1]
# 2. [Step 2]
# ...
#
# Description of Output:
# [What is returned by this function].
# Type: [Return type].
# Output Range/Expected: [Typical or possible values].
# Side Effects: [Any changes made to objects passed by reference or global state].
